# Onscreen-Joystick
This is an old project I made for Windows 8 to provide an on-screen gamepad for games. It's no longer under development and is only uploaded to archive the source.


Features:
Configurable for positions/keys pressed
Multi-touch support
Written in .Net, so one binary works on ARM and x86/x64
Open-Source


Documentation on how to use the configs should be at the top of the provided sample config.
